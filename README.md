# BrackeysGameJam2021.2
My submission for the Brackeys 2021.2 Game Jam - Apocalypse Runner (my first game jam)

A 3D side-view platformer game made from scratch by me using Unity3D and C#. My first ever game created with Unity over the course of 1 week.

A game jam is a competition in which one creates a game from scratch using any program they wish that aligns with a certain theme. This particular game jam had the theme "Let There Be Chaos."
